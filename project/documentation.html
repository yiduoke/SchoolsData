<h1> Description </h1>
<p> Our website will display correlations in the form of graphs between race, gender, disability, etc, and academic performance. This will especially interest researchers of education. The graphs will be scatter plots and bar graphs. </p>

<h1> Personnel </h1>
<p> Vincent Jiang, Margaret Ke (period 4) <br>
Fraction of time contributed by Vincent: 1/1 <br>
Fraction of time contributed by Margaret: 1/1 <br>
(We have always worked together)  </p>

<h1> Citations</h1>
<h2> people </h2>
<p> Thanks to Mr. Holmes for providing a documentation template. </p>
<p> Margaret¡¯s brother coded a function that ranks sublists according to numerical value. </p>

<h2> programming </h2>
<p> The rank function was coded by Margaret¡¯s brother. The rank1 function is based off of this, as well. </p>
<p> We also used Plotly to produce the graphs and JSFiddle to produce the drop-down menu with css elements. </p>

<h2> data sources </h2>
<p> NYC Open Data provided all the data we used in this project. </p>

<h1> Desirable features, with time estimates</h1>
<p> To be used: </p>
<ul>
<li> HTML forms to allow user interaction through the Internet. 
There will be two drop down menus so that the user can select which categories to compare.</li>
<li> Back-end Python programs to calculate the correlations and to generate graphs 
displaying these correlations. </li>
<li> CSV files to store data. </li>
</ul>
<p> Plan: </p>
<ol>
<li> Organize all the data into dictionaries - 40 minutes </li>
<li> Put values into list, grouped by ethnicity, gender, etc. - 30 minutes </li>
<li> Figure out how to create graphs in Python. - 2 hours </li>
<li> Create a script that fuses together data regarding school rank and scores. - 15 minutes </li>
<li> Create a usable html page. - 1 hour </li>
<li> Finish documentation. - 25 minutes </li>
</ol>

<h1> Achievements </h1>
<p> We ranked scores of various tests using tables. </p>
<p> We created graphs using the data from csv files generated by python programs.</p>
<p> We created drop down menus and submenus in navbars to allow for ease of use. </p>

<h2> Features of note </h2>
<p> We spent some time researching the drop down menus and submenus. </p>
<p> The navbar is pretty cool. </p>
<p> It took a while to figure out a way to display comparisons of the data using graphs </p>

<h2> Learning </h2>
<p> We learned some CSS, the lambda element of Python, and discovered Plotly.</p>

<h1> Next Steps, with time estimates </h1>
<ul>
<li> Provide a textbox where a user can enter a school code. This will cause that portion of the table to have a bold font, making locating that piece of data easier. - 40 minutes </li>
<li> Eliminate the weird data at the bottom of the tables, or fix them. - 1 hour </li>
<li> Add titles to pages. - 10 minutes </li>
</ul>

<h1> Finished Steps, identified by worker </h1>
<ul>
<li> Trim the csv files and turn the data into dictionaries. - Both </li>
<li> Supplied the python function that converts a csv file to dictionary - Vincent </li>
<li> Write the web pages. - Both      </li>
<li> Turn dictionaries into lists, rank them, then turn them into tables - Both, though mostly Margaret.</li>
</ul>
<h1> Bugs </h1>
<p> The tables aren¡¯t completely correct. The first rows are riddled with peculiar errors, which did not make sense to us. </p>
